GPS Sat Pointer is a sample Android application demonstrating how to
use a SurfaceView to display a dynamically-updated set of 3D arrows
with OpenGL showing the position of GPS satellites and the current
compass orientation.

Note I use a SurfaceView, not a GLSurfaceView. I don't do the OpenGL
drawing directly on-screen, I do it off-screen to composite with my
own additional graphics before display.

The source code includes the following utility classes:
  * EGLUseful: management of EGL context and doing offscreen OpenGL
    rendering using either pbuffers or bitmaps
  * GeomBuilder: basic management of 3D object geometry and rendering
  * Lathe: uses GeomBuilder to construct objects with rotational symmetry
  * Mat4f: functional operations on matrices representing 3D homogeneous coordinates
  * VectorView: how to use sensor data to draw 3D direction arrows
  * Vec3f: functional operations on vectors representing 3D coordinates

Note that the compass direction is often inaccurate to begin with.
However, turning the phone this way and that will often nudge it
back into a sensible reading.
