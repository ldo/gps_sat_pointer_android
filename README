GPS Sat Pointer is a sample Android application demonstrating how to use a
SurfaceView to display a dynamically-updated set of 3D arrows with
OpenGL showing the position of GPS satellites and the current compass
orientation. The source code includes the following utility classes:
  * EGLUseful: management of EGL context and doing offscreen OpenGL
    rendering using pbuffers
  * GeomBuilder: basic management of 3D object geometry and rendering
  * Lathe: uses GeomBuilder to construct objects with rotational symmetry
  * Mat4f: functional operations on matrices representing 3D homogeneous coordinates
  * VectorView: how to use sensor data to draw 3D direction arrows
  * Vec3f: functional operations on vectors representing 3D coordinates

Note that the compass direction is sometimes inaccurate--at least, on
my HTC Desire it is. However, turning the phone this way and that will
often nudge it back into a sensible reading.
